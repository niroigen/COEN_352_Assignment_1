1.3.5 What does the following code fragment print when N is 50? Give a high-level description of what it does when presented with a positive integer N.
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
    while (N > 0)
    {
       stack.push(N % 2);
	   N = N / 2; 
}
    for (int d : stack) StdOut.print(d);
    StdOut.println();
Answer : Prints the binary representation of N (110010 when N is 50).


When the number 50 is set to N and it calls this method,
the process in which this would work is that the remainder of N/2 is pushed to the stack
And then N will be divided by 2.

This process will occur until N reaches to 0
